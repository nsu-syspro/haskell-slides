Grading \centering
-------

- Final grade is assigned either based on points for homework assignments
  - **A** --- 70+ points in total (6+ in each homework)
  - **B** --- 60+ points in total (3+ in each homework)
  - **C** --- 50+ points in total
- Or by passing grading theory test consisting of
  - 2 random questions from different modules
  - 1 random exercise from homework assignments
- Students wishing to improve grade based on homework points
  may pass theory test instead
  - In that case their grade from theory test will be the final grade
