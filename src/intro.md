Grading \centering
-------

- Final grade is assigned either based on points for homework assignments
  - **A** --- 8+ in each homework
  - **B** --- 7+ in each homework
  - **C** --- 6+ in each homework
- Or by passing final theory test comprising
  - 2 random questions from different modules
  - 1 practical exercise similar to tasks from homework assignments
- Students wishing to improve grade based on homework points
  may pass theory test instead
  - In that case their grade from theory test will be the final grade
